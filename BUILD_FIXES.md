# Build Configuration Issues and Solutions

## Critical Issue: Java Version Mismatch

**Problem:** 
- The project is configured to use Java 17 (as specified in gradle.properties and build.gradle.kts)
- Your system currently has Java 8 (1.8.0_401) installed
- This version mismatch prevents successful compilation

**Solutions:**

### Option 1: Install Java 17+ (Recommended)
1. Download and install Java 17 or higher from:
   - Oracle JDK: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html
   - OpenJDK: https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/17/
   - Or use a version manager like SDKMAN or Adoptium

2. Update your system PATH to point to the new Java installation:
   - Windows: Update JAVA_HOME system environment variable to point to Java 17 installation directory
   - Example: JAVA_HOME = C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17

3. Verify the installation:
   ```
   java -version
   javac -version
   ```

### Option 2: Downgrade Project Configuration (Not Recommended)
If you must use Java 8, you can modify the project configuration files:

1. In gradle.properties, change:
   ```
   JAVA_VERSION=8
   KOTLIN_JVM_TARGET=8
   ```

2. In app/build.gradle.kts, change:
   ```kotlin
   compileOptions {
       sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
       targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
   }
   
   kotlinOptions {
       jvmTarget = "1.8"
   }
   ```

3. In root build.gradle.kts, also update the subprojects configuration to use Java 8.

**Note:** Option 2 is not recommended as modern Android development requires Java 8+, and many libraries require Java 11+ or 17+.

## Fixed Issue: AGP Version

The AGP version in libs.versions.toml was incorrectly set to "8.13.0", which is not a valid version. This has been fixed to "8.2.2".

## How to Build After Java Installation

1. After installing Java 17+, clean previous build artifacts:
   ```
   .\gradlew clean
   ```

2. Try building the project:
   ```
   .\gradlew build
   ```

3. To build the APK:
   ```
   .\gradlew assembleDebug
   ```

## Additional Notes

- The project uses modern Android development practices including Hilt for DI, Room for database, and Jetpack Compose for UI
- The minimum SDK version is 26 (Android 8.0) as specified in the configuration
- The target SDK version is 34 (Android 14) as required by Google Play Store

## Potential Additional Issues

- Configuration cache is enabled in gradle.properties (org.gradle.configuration-cache=true). If you encounter issues, try disabling it temporarily.
- KSP (Kotlin Symbol Processing) is used for Hilt and Room compilation. Make sure the versions in libs.versions.toml are compatible.
