## Data Safety Section Answers

**No**

### Is your app exempt from the Privacy Policy & Security Practices requirement?
**Yes**

**Reason:** Our app does not collect, transmit, or share any personal or sensitive user data. All data is stored locally on the user's device and is never transmitted to external servers.

### Additional Information

The only permissions that might appear to collect data are required by the Android operating system for Wi-Fi scanning functionality:

1. **ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION**: Required by Android since version 6.0 to scan Wi-Fi networks. We do NOT use this permission to track your physical location.

2. **NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES**: Required by Android 13+ for Wi-Fi scanning. We do NOT use this permission for location purposes.

These permissions are used exclusively for the core functionality of Wi-Fi network scanning and analysis, and no location data is ever collected or transmitted.
